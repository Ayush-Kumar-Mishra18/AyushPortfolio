Ammonia Salts:-

Ammonia salts, commonly known as smelling salts, are chemical compounds (typically ammonium carbonate mixed with water and alcohol) that release a sharp, pungent smell when opened. When inhaled, the fumes irritate the nasal membranes and respiratory tract, causing a sudden increase in alertness and breathing rate.

Uses in the Gym:-

1. Mental Wake-Up: Athletes use smelling salts before heavy lifts (like squats or deadlifts) to sharpen focus and boost mental intensity.
2. Temporary Adrenaline Spike: Inhalation can trigger a quick rush of adrenaline, which may improve performance during short, high-effort lifts.
3. Used in Powerlifting and Strongman Sports: Especially common in powerlifting competitions, where maximum effort is required.

⚠️ Note:-
Smelling salts should be used with caution. Overuse or misuse can irritate the respiratory system and may not be suitable for all individuals.
